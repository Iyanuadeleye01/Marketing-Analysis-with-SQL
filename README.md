# üìä Direct Marketing Campaign Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project explores a dataset from a direct marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The campaign involved outreach via phone calls to promote a term deposit product. The goal of this analysis is to uncover actionable insights that can enhance the effectiveness of future campaigns.

As part of the Internpulse Data Analytics Internship, I applied **SQL** for querying and data transformation, and **Power BI** for creating interactive visualizations to communicate key insights clearly to stakeholders.

##  Objectives

- Conduct comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL.
- Analyze campaign effectiveness based on variables such as age, job, education, marital status, and previous campaign outcomes.
- Connect SQL outputs to Power BI for dynamic visualization.
- Develop an **interactive dashboard** to communicate findings.
- Summarize insights into a concise report with actionable business recommendations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: Data transformation and aggregation via SQL views
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard and reporting

##  SQL Queries Summary

I created several SQL views to explore various dimensions of the campaign:

- **`job_subscription_rate`**: Subscription success rate by job type.
- **`age_subscription_rate`**: Subscription rate grouped by age range.
- **`marital_subscription_rate`**: Comparison of marital status and subscription outcome.
- **`education_subscription_rate`**: Educational background impact on subscription.
- **`housing_subscription_rate`**: Analysis of housing loan status and its influence.
- **`month_subscription_rate`**: Month-by-month conversion rate.
- **`poutcome_subscription_rate`**: Effect of past campaign outcomes on success.
- **`duration_subscription_rate`**: Influence of call duration on conversion likelihood.
- **`overall_campaign_success`**: General campaign subscription rate summary.
- **`balance_subscription_effect`**: Financial balance trends among subscribed vs non-subscribed customers.

Each view was designed to be reusable and insightful for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

The insights from the SQL queries were visualized in Power BI and compiled into a fully interactive dashboard. The report includes:

- Demographic and behavioral breakdowns
- Conversion trends across different customer segments
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for campaign success
- Strategic recommendations based on data patterns
